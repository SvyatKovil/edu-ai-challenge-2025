I'm a QA engineer. I found a bug on Safari. See description below:
“Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”

I need to convert existing description into bug-ticket structured like:
- Title
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Environment (if known)
- Severity or Impact
